# Introducing the ESP8266 OLED Display + Web Server Example

Hello, my name is Jean. I'm an IT professional with a passion for learning programming and educating others in coding.

I recently purchased an ESP8266 that comes with an integrated OLED display. I was looking for examples to learn how to operate this device and display information on the screen, but all I discovered were videos on YouTube demonstrating the device in action, without any accompanying code.

My actions were:

- Set up the device to show text and graphics on the OLED screen.
- Establish a web service by:
- Connecting the ESP8266 to a wireless network.
- Starting up a web service.
- Defining the handlers for the employed endpoints.

To implement this code on your device:

- Clone in your computer this repository.
- In the Arduino IDE:
    * Input the following URL into the additional board manager URLs: https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
    * Utilize the library manager to find and include the “ESP8266 and ESP32 OLED driver for SSD1306 displays” library.
    * Select “NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)” as your target board in the Arduino IDE.
    * Load the provided script onto your device and begin using it.

Get in touch, I would be delighted to discuss technology topics with you.
